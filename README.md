This repository has

1) Folder : "CnnExtract" (doesn't contain .htaccess)
2) Zip File : "CnnExtract.zip" - I upload this because github doesn't allow to upload .htaccess file. So unzipping this zip file will give you the "CnnExtract" Folder including .htaccess file in it.

Steps to use the project:
1) After extracting zip file. Place the extracted folder "CnnExtract" in php server root folder, so the path will be something like C:<root folder path>/CnnExtract

2) After hosted the project to view the page on browser go to "http://<some_domain_root>/CnnExtract/index".
Note:Folder CnnExtract Should be on root folder.

3) In that page 2 previously tested urls are given for your convenience. You can also use it to test.

4) If any problem in these I also host the same on internet for your easy access. The URL is http://cnnextract.x10host.com/CnnExtract/index
